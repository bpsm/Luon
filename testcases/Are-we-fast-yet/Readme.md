This is a version of the "Are We Fast Yet" benchmark suite
migrated to the Luon language.

The original files are in my [Are-we-fast-yet repository](https://github.com/rochus-keller/are-we-fast-yet/) and copied here for convenience.

See the original repository for more information and performance results.
